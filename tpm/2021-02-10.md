# Feburary 10, 2021 Work Diary

As an interesting side-note, the stock market experienced a mild crash today (notably, TQQQ dropped by ~$5) and I wound up making a bunch of ITM trades. We'll see how this plays out next week when these trades expire.

In the meantime, let's continue with last week's GUI. Since last week I put together the server side for building sessions, this week, let's put together the client side for locking in a training set

## Update: On material ui

These resources were helpful in getting me started on customizing styling on react-side to make the UI mor readable

- [color](https://material-ui.com/customization/color/)
- [typography](https://material-ui.com/components/typography/#typography)
- [theme](https://material-ui.com/customization/globals/#default-props)

## Update 2

The mutations and queries now work to allow me to set an active training set, however, I'm having trouble getting the UI to properly update in real-time to reflect the change. This is likely because how I'm using `useMemo` in `TrainingSetList/api.ts`

TODOs
- `useReducer` in `TrainingSetList/api.ts`
- ensure that sessions are persisting across refreshes

## Update 3 (Feb 17)

- Fixed the useMemo in TrainingSEtList/api not updating properly
- in addition, sessions now properly persist across session (and across tabs)

Remaining TODOs:

- Create the screenshot ui that will allow me to send pics back to the python
