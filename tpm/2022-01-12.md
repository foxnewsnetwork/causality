# January 12, 2022 Afterwork diary

Continue on the [Jan 10th entry](./2022-01-10.md), we continue to explore the SWIFT language starting off with [subscripts](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Subscripts.html)

## Subscripts

These guys are a special kind of property, and they are used to access the elements of an array, dictionary, or other collection.

```swift
struct Gamepad {
  var buttons = [Button]()
  subscript(button: Button) -> String {
    get {
      return "Button \(button.rawValue)"
    }
    set {
      if let index = buttons.index(of: button) {
        buttons[index] = Button(rawValue: newValue)!
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In addition, subscripts may have different number of arguments to achieve matrix access behavior

Finally, type scripts are declared via `static` keyword to be used at the "class" level

```swift
enum GamepadButton {
  case a, b, x, y, leftShoulder, rightShoulder, leftTrigger, rightTrigger,
  leftStickPress, rightStickPress, dpadUp, dpadDown, dpadLeft, dpadRight,
  menu, view, leftThumbstick, rightThumbstick, system

  static subscript(name: String) -> GamepadButton? {
    return GamepadButton(rawValue: name)
  }
}
```

## [Inheritance](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Inheritance.html)

`override` keyword must be explicitly used to indicate overriding

```swift
class Train: Vehicle {
  override func makeNoise() {
    print("Choo Choo")
  }

  override var noise: String {
    get {
      return 'Choo Choo'
    }
    didSet {
      print("Train noise changed to \(noise)")
    }
    willSet {
      print("Train noise will change to \(newValue)")
    }
  }
}
```

`final` keyword prevents subclasses from overriding

IMHO, excessive support for this sort inheritance based programming has leads to shitty code, so I should be aware of using it excessively

## [Initializatio](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Initialization.html)

```swift
class Color {
  let red, green, blue: Double
}
```

Swift automatically provides an initializer with argument labels corresponding to the properties of the class, thus:

```swift
let tourmaline = Color(red: 1.0, green: 0.2, blue: 0.4)
```

will _just work_

Note that initializers must _always_ be called with argument labels:

```swift
let cyan = Color(0.0, 1.0, 0.3) // error
```

label-less initializers only work when explicitly declared via `_`

```swift
class PrimeNumber {
  let number: Int
  init(_ number: Int) {
    self.number = number
  }
}

let seven = PrimeNumber(7)
```

Unassigned properties take on the value of `nil`

Note on function signatures: 

In swift (probably as carry-over from objective-c), function signatures

```swift
class Race {
  let distance: Double
  let location: Location
}
```

would have the init signature of `init(distance:location:)`

`convenience init` must eventually call a regular `init`

`init?` can potentially return nil

enumerations automatically get a failable initializer

```swift
enum TemperatureUnit {
  case kelvin = "K", celsius = "C", fahrenheit = "F"
}
if let unit = TemperatureUnit(rawValue: "K") {
  print("Kelvin is \(unit)")
}
```

use `super.init` to refer to parent's initializer

use `required init` to indicate that a subclass must call a designated initializer

Finally, use `deinit` to define a deinitializer (aka "destructor")

## [Optional Chaining](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/OptionalChaining.html)

```swift
struct Person {
  var residence: Residence?
}
let john = Person()
john.residence?.numberOfRooms // nil
john.residence!.numberOfRooms // to _explicitly_ throw an error if residence is null
```

Note that subscript access is slightly different than in javascript `john.residence?[0]` instead of `john.residence?.[0]`


## [Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html)

functions that throw must be explicitly declared as throw

```swift
func canThrowError(msg: String) throws -> String {
  // this function may or may not throw an error
  return "Uh-oh"
}
```

Errors are typically enums that inherit from Error

```swift
enum VendingMachineError: Error {
    case invalidSelection
    case insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: Int)
    case outOfStock
}
```

Then we throw these errors in methods (possibly with guard statements)

```swift
class VendingMachine {
  func vend(name: String) throws {
    guard let item = inventory[name] else {
      throw VendingMachineError.invalidSelection
    }
  }
}
```

calling methods that throw requires using a `try` keyword like so

```swift
func tryVendingMachine(name: String) throws -> String{
  let machine = VendingMachine()
  try machine.vend(name: name)
  return "Success"
}
```

use the `do` and `catch` blocks to handle throwing functions

```swift
do {
  try tryVendingMachine(name: "Candy")
} catch VendingMachineError.invalidSelection {
  print("Invalid selection.")
} catch VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds(let coinsNeeded) {
  print("Insufficient funds. Please insert an additional \(coinsNeeded) coins.")
} catch {
  print("Unexpected error: \(error).")
}
```

use `try?` to safely call throwing functions (failing results in nil)

use `try!` to tell swift to "just fucking do it, I know better", in which case, errors become runtime errors (lol)

## [Concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html)

Next time, we start on `async`, `defer`, `await` and swift's suite of parallelism and concurrency handling
