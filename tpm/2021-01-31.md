# January 31, 2021 Work Diary

Continuing from Friday's work, it's time to continue putting together the mutation side of the react ui (followed by the image creation / labeller thing)

## First things

I will want to install material icons to get access to buttons and such. 

```zsh
yarn add @material-ui/icon
```

allows me to add the Floating Action Button via:

```jsx
import { Typography, Fab } from '@material-ui/core';
import AddIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Add';

<Fab color="primary" aria-label="add">
  <AddIcon />
</Fab>
```

In addition, I consulted the following sources

- [on apollo graphql mutations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/)
- [material ui form control](https://material-ui.com/api/form-control/)
- [material ui text-control examples](https://material-ui.com/components/text-fields/)

## Update

Putting all this together, we are now properly able to create training sets from the react UI. Next steps are as follows:

- Create GUI to take and upload pictures into a training set
- Create GUI to label images in a training set
- Create GUI to create a neural network
- Create GUI to train neural network
