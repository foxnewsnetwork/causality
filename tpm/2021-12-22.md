# December 22, 2021 Work Diary

Eventually, I want to be able to put together:

- Something that launches the SIE remote play feature
- Something that emulates DS4 button presses
- Everything should be in separate docker containers they can communicate via web apis

## TODOs

- Learn about MacOS app development
  - I need an MacOS app which can convert button network signals to DS4 button presses
- Split up project into monorepo with applications and packages that can be built together with a shell script (or make file)

## Swift

First up, I need to learn how to use Swift.
Currently at https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html

### Opaque View Types

https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/OpaqueTypes.html

```swift
var body: some View {
  Text("Hello, world!")
    .padding()
}
```
