# January 14, 2021 Work Journey

## State of project (beginning)

- python server side graphQL rigged up
- used insomnia to emulate response in previou session
- have some idea that we need to do tensorflow next, but uncertain how to proceed

## Activity

Reading through [basic tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) on keras classification

From my understanding, it seems the workflow of tensorflow is something as follows

- get training set data
- get training set labels
- generate model with parameters based upon feelings
- train
- test with test set

This means the workflow I'll need to build a GUI on the react side is some way of capturing images and assigning labels to images to facilitate creating the training set.

### Sidebar: on images and eyes

I'm a little confused on how I should go about with the image screen-capturing business and what sort of stuff I should train it for.

Lacking any insight, I think the first model I'd want to train is perhaps something along the lines of "focus" so that I can use it to find interesting objects on the screen. In addition, I'd like the models I train to be, in some ways, "modular"

Anyway, loose ideas for now, but stuff I'd want to keep in mind

## Specs

In any case, here's what I'll need

- ability to upload image from react to server
- ability to save image on server
- ability to associate some label / value to the image

## Uploading Images via flask

To upload an image, I'm going to follow the guide [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/fileuploads/)

This results in the following code (simply dumped into `__init__.py`)

```python
@app.route('/image', methods=['POST'])
def upload_image():
    file = request.files['file']
    data_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'data')
    list = os.listdir(data_dir)
    number_files = len(list)
    filename = os.path.join(data_dir, f'{number_files}.png')
    file.save(filename)
    return filename
```

## Update

Apparently, there's a [Flask-Upload](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Uploads/) extension that does everything I need. Lol going to just use that (also [github page](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-uploads))

Reading more about [flask extensions](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/extensions/) here, it seems there's a few conventions I should follow

- put configs into app.config
- pass app into the extension's initializer
