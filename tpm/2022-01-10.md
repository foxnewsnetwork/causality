# January 10, 2022 Afterwork diary

Continue on the [Jan 6th entry](./2022-01-06.md), we continue to explore the SWIFT language starting off with [classes](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html)

## Structs and Classes

The critical difference between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they are passed around, while classes are passed by reference.

Apparently, the `=` is thus sometimes a "copy" command while sometimes it's an "assign" command

```swift
struct Resolution {
  var width = 0
  var height = 0
}

let hd = Resolution(width: 1920, height: 1080)
var cinema = hd // equivalent to var cinema = Resolution(width: 1920, height: 1080)
```

## Properties

[properties](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html) are members of structs, classes, and even enums

const structs and enums cannot have their properties reassigned

```swift
struct Point {
  var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
}

let point = Point(x: 1.0, y: 2.0)
point.x = 3.0 // throws
```

`lazy` vars are only computed once, and then stored in memory

`get` and `set` syntax

```swift
struct Rect {
  var origin = Point()
  var size = Size()
  var center: Point {
    get {
      let centerX = origin.x + (size.width / 2)
      let centerY = origin.y + (size.height / 2)
      return Point(x: centerX, y: centerY)
    }
    set(newCenter) {
      origin.x = newCenter.x - (size.width / 2)
      origin.y = newCenter.y - (size.height / 2)
    }
  }
}
```

Side-effects and hooks (for some reason, swift decides to bake this _directly_ into the language itself)

```swift
struct Gamepad {
  var pressedKey: String = "" {
    willSet {
      print("\(pressedKey) will be set to \(newValue)")
    }
    didSet {
      print("\(oldValue) was set to \(pressedKey)")
    }
  }
}
```

Property wrappers are how swift handles decorators.

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct MaxConcurrency {
  private let limit: Int;
  init(limit: Int) {
    self.limit = limit
  }
  var wrappedValue: Int {
    get {
      return _value
    }
    set {
      if newValue > limit {
        _value = limit
      } else {
        _value = newValue
      }
    }
  }
}
```

projectedValues are a newfangled way to get "metadata" about a property

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct MaxConcurrency {
  private let limit: Int;
  private(set) var projectedValue: Bool;
  init(limit: Int) {
    self.limit = limit
    self.projectedValue = false
  }
  var projectedValue: Int {
    get {
      return _value
    }
    set {
      if newValue > limit {
        _value = limit
      } else {
        _value = newValue
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Static properties come in 2 variants: overrideable and non-overrideable

```swift
class SomeClass {
  static var someTypeProperty = "some value"
  class var otherTypeProperty: String {
    return "some other value"
  }
}
```

## Methods

Methods are generally just like properties except they're functions

```swift
class SomeClass {
  var dog: String = "fido"
  func someMethod() {
    return "some value"
  }
  @discardableResult
  mutating func mutatingMethod() {
    self.dog = "spot"
  }
}
```

Thus they can be decorated, overridden, declared as static, etc.

## Subscripts

We will continue next time with [subscripts](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Subscripts.html) which apparently are for allowing you to access a value at a specific index like `dog[3]`
