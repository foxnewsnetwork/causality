# January 19, 2022 Afterwork diary

Continue on the [Jan 12th entry](./2022-01-12.md), we continue to explore the SWIFT language starting off with [Concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html)

## [Concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html)

Very similar to javascript, we have `async` and `await`

```swift
func fetchExperience(alias: String) async -> Experience {
  let experience = await Client.instance.fetchExperience(alias: alias)
  return experience
}
```

The key difference here is that `async` is implemented potentially across threads while holding execution, instead of using promises like we do in single-threaded javascript

Note, unlike in javascript where `for` cannot iterate over asyncIterators, in swift this is possible via [AsyncSequences](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence)

Notably, in javascript, we can't do the following yet

- see [for-await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of)

```typescript
async function* asyncGenerator() {
  yield 1
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
  yield 2
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
  yield 3
}

for await (const value of asyncGenerator()) {
  console.log(value)
}
// 1
// *waits 1 second*
// 2
// *waits another second*
// 3
```

however, this appears to entirely possible in swift

```swift
struct Counter: AsyncIterator, AsyncSequence {
  var limit: Int
  var count: Int = 0

  mutating func next() async -> Int? {
    if count < limit {
      count += 1
      await Task.sleep(1_000_000) // 1 second
      return count
    } else {
      return nil
    }
  }
}

for try await number in Counter(limit: 3) {
  print(number)
}
```

### On Iterators and Generators

Swift doesn't support 1st class language support for generators and iterators like we do in javascript, instead, [sequences](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence) and [async sequences](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence) are used to implement the same functionality... just via protocols instead of `function*`

```swift
struct FibonacciSequence: Sequence {
  func makeIterator() -> FibonacciIterator {
    return FibonacciIterator()
  }
}
for fib in FibonacciSequence() {
  print(fib)
}
```
or alternatively

```swift
struct FiboSequence: Sequence, IteratorProtocol {
  var previous: Int = 0
  var current: Int = 1
  mutating func next() -> Int? {
    let nextValue = previous + current
    previous = current
    current = nextValue
    return current
  }
}
for fib in FiboSequence() {
  print(fib)
}
```

### Using the `async` keyword

Apparently, it's possible to use `async` to "lift" an expression into some sort of promise that can be later awaited (technically called "tasks" in swift)

```swift
async let res1 = fetchExperience(alias: "tourmaline")
async let res2 = fetchExperience(alias: "cyan")
async let res3 = fetchExperience(alias: "magenta")

let colors = await [res1, res2, res3]
```

which is equivalent to `Promise.all` from js

```js
await Promise.all([
  fetchExperience(alias: "tourmaline"),
  fetchExperience(alias: "cyan"),
  fetchExperience(alias: "magenta")
])
```

### Task and TaskGroups

[TaskGroup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/taskgroup) is a way to group tasks together, and [Task](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task) is a way to represent a single task that can be awaited

swift's task and task groups are a _lot_ closer to elixir's [tasks](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html), except here's no supervisor restarting stuff

We'll cross this bridge when we get there

### Actors

A somewhat intersting concept in swift is the [actor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/actor) model, which is a way to implement a simple message passing model in swift

```swift
actor MovingAverage {
  var measurements: [Double] = []
  var average: Double {
    get {
      return measurements.reduce(0, +) / Double(measurements.count)
    }
  }

  func receive(message: Double) {
    measurements.append(message)
  }
}

let sma = MovingAverage()
await [
  sma.receive(message: 1),
  sma.receive(message: 2),
  sma.receive(message: 3),
]
print(await sma.average)
```

In other words, when outside the actor, _all_ properties (and presumably functions) are async executions and swift automatically ensures that we're not concurrently accessing the same property or function.

In javascript, we got this behavior for free because we were single-threaded, but in swift, we have to explicitly tell the compiler that we're not accessing the same property or function concurrently
