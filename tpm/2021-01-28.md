# January 28, 2021 Work Diary

Although I've been adding bits of code into the react side of things, the coding sessions haven't been long enough to warrant starting a new entry in the diary. In anycase, today I intend to get working the react side of things for connecting up with apollo and graphql

## Update

First setup is the setup the query on the client side to pull data from my python server. As usual, a review of how to [pull queries from apollo guides](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/queries/) proves to be helpful

In addition, [here is a guide for nesting routes in react](https://reactrouter.com/web/example/nesting)

Another sidenote is that apparently graphql expects data to be wrapped inside the data field as per [this post on stack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48245570/react-apollo-network-error-server-response-was-missing-for-query-hello)

## TODOs

- incorporate material icons for easier development  [icon components](https://material-ui.com/components/icons/)
- setup mutation UIs
