# January 16, 2021 Work Diary

Continuing from last time, I think the goal for this session is to make progress setting up the Flask-Upload for images

## Update 1

From the sources from last time, I'm going to copy+paste code from [flask upload example](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-uploads/blob/master/example/photolog.py) to get myself started

## Update 2

Encountered an upload issue:

```
  File "/Users/conformity/.local/share/virtualenvs/causality-pk4GMq_8/lib/python3.6/site-packages/flask/cli.py", line 240, in locate_app
    __import__(module_name)
  File "/Users/conformity/Documents/Github/causality/causality/__init__.py", line 5, in <module>
    from flask_uploads import (UploadSet, configure_uploads, IMAGES)
  File "/Users/conformity/.local/share/virtualenvs/causality-pk4GMq_8/lib/python3.6/site-packages/flask_uploads.py", line 26, in <module>
    from werkzeug import secure_filename, FileStorage
ImportError: cannot import name 'secure_filename'
```

apparently, as according to [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61628503/flask-uploads-importerror-cannot-import-name-secure-filename), this is because Flask.Uploads is using an outdated version of [werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/)

In anycase, the solution is to use a drop-in replacement for the Flask.Uploads via [flask reupload](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Reuploaded/)

## Update 3

Apparently, uploading mulitpart forms via insomnia is a little tricky. Notably, if you do ctrl+space and select file upload, it won't work. However, you must select "File" from the small dropdown on the right-hand side of the Multi-part form field then it should be ok


## Some protips

- `UPLOADED_PHOTOS_DEST` is from the project directory, thus `causality/data/img` gets it into the correct folder

## Remainging TODOs

- Figure out a way to properly name uploaded files
- Drag in a sqlite db and ORM to associate uploaded images with entries in a db
- Figure out better error handling on python side (i.e. how-to 500)
