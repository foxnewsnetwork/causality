# Feburary 7, 2021 Work Diary

Due to Hackathon at work, I had little time to work on this project, but this Sunday, I'm back. Continuing from last time, we have our little GUI for creating neural nets and such, and now we want to put together the ability to take picture and then label those pictures.

In any case, I will need to install session context on server side and then use that to determine where pictures should go

## Update

To install session, I [follow this guide](https://flask-session.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Some issues:

```
The session is unavailable because no secret
```

As per [this stackoverflow artcile](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35657821/the-session-is-unavailable-because-no-secret-key-was-set-set-the-secret-key-on/35657961), apparently, this has to do with what sort of strategy we're using for session. TL;DR is to just use filesystem

Resolving all of this, we know have a new session endpoint that setups the ability to stores session data in filesystem via either post or graphQL
