# January 6, 2022 Afterwork diary

Continuing from the [Dec 12 entry](./2021-12-22.md), I continue with my reading of the SWIFT language documentation starting off at [closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html)

We'll see how far we can get, but the eventual goal will be:

## Goals

- Get the stuff in [applications/MacOSDs4](../applications/MacOSDs4) to build
  - Tests be put in and running
  - Build should work on my current machine
  - Should have outline of plan regarding what I need to explore in apple docs to understand how shockemu works

## [Function](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html) notes


```swift
func greet(person: String, from hometown: String) -> String {
  return "Hello \(person)!  Glad you could visit from \(hometown)."
}

greet(person: "bill", from: "oakland")
```

- `person` is the "parameter name"
- `from` is the "parameter label" (optional)
- functions may be invoked with and without labels

In the example above:

```swift
greet("bill", "oakland")

// equivalent to

greet(person: "bill", from: "oakland")
greet("bill", from: "oakland")
```

though I'd imagine inconsistently using labels is a bad idea

Function types don't require labels

```swift
var welcome: (String, String) -> String = {
  "Hello \($0)!  Glad you could visit from \($1)."
}
```

>note: Apparently, this isn't like typescript where the types can be created like alises, however, there is the `typealias` keyword (see [this article](https://www.programiz.com/swift-programming/typealias))

```swift
typealias Metric<T> = (T, T) -> UInt
```

>TODO: figure out how type "reflection" keywords such as typescript's `typeof`, `keyof`, `infer`, `ReturnType<T>`, etc, would work in swift (or indeed if equivalents even exist)

## [Closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html) notes

aka lambdas, anonymous functions, and anonymous methods

### Anonymous functions

```swift
let compare = { (a: Int, b: Int) -> Bool in
  return a < b
}
```

is equivalent to:

```typescript
const compare = (a: number, b: number) => a < b
```

and similarly in ruby (see [reference](https://www.rubyguides.com/2016/02/ruby-procs-and-lambdas/))

```ruby
compare = ->(a, b) {
  a < b
}
```

Although ruby is dead (long live ruby), swift takes some inspiration and implements bunch of ways to drop syntax:

```swift
let c1 = { (a: Int, b: Int) -> Bool in
  return a < b
}

let c2 = { a, b in return a < b }
let c3 = { a, b in a < b }
let c4 = { $0 < $1 }
names.sort(by: <)
```

(where `c5` is special ["operator" syntax](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html#ID42) that we probably won't use) 

Furthermore, in an analogy to ruby's `do` blocks notation, swift does pretty much the same thing:

```swift
names.sort { $0 < $1 }
```

```ruby
names.sort do |a, b|
  a < b
end
```

(as long as it's the final parameter of the implementation of the `sort` method. _ONLY_ the final parameter can be a closure passed in anonymously like so)

> NOTE: there is some weirdness regarding `@escaping` closures and how memory is handled. I'll probably revisit this later. Escapes and self references are an issue in swift (and not in javascript) likely because of actual multithreaded concurrency (as oppose to javascript's single threaded asynchrony)

> Note2: there is also `@autoclosure` which converts expressions into closures. I will review this later as meta-programming of this sort if often "too clever" for purposes other than making additions to the language itself

## [Enumeration](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html) notes

Enums in swift is much more powerful than in any other language I've worked with.

They can implement [protocols](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html):

```swift
enum GamepadInput: CaseIterable {
  case up, down, left, right, square, triangle, cross, circle, L1, R1, L2, R2, select, start
}

GamepadInput.allCases.count
for key in GamepadInput.allCases {
  print(key)
}
```

In addition, enums can be used to implement discriminated unions:

```typescript
type Shape = Circle | Rectangle | Triangle
interface Circle {
  radius: number
}
interface Rectangle {
  width: number
  height: number
}
interface Triangle {
  side: number
  leg: number
  angle: number
}
```

```swift
enum Shape {
  case circle(radius: Double)
  case rectangle(width: Double, height: Double)
  case triangle(side: Double, leg: Double, angle: Double)
}
```

### Raw values

For my purposes of _actually_ sending in raw binary input into some sort of IPC channel into the OS so that it may transfer the input to the remote play session, I will need to encode my `GamepadInput` enum into raw value binary format:


```swift
enum GamepadInput: CaseIterable, Character {
  case up = "\u{1B}[A" // up arrow
  case down = "\u{1B}[B" // down arrow
  case left = "\u{1B}[D" // left arrow
  case right = "\u{1B}[C" // right arrow
  // etc
}
```

>Note: the above code snippet was autocompleted by co-pilot, a TODO for me will be to figure out what the _actual_ binary raw values are


### Recursive enumerations

Swift provides `indirect` keyword to handle recursive enumerations.

> TODO: figure out a usecase for this later, but for now, it seems like a fun curiosity but nothing more beyond that (well, outside of building languages)

## Stuctures and classes (for next time)

Stopping on [classes](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html), going to continue my exploration of swift next time.
