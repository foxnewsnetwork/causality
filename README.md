# Causality

Here is my attempt to create a utility library that captures the contents behind [Causality](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/book-toc.html) book and to use it to complete the [associated homework assignments](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/viewgraphs.html). Finally, to demonstrate that I've at least somewhat come to understand this field, I'd like to use all this to build a "class project" (in quotes because I've been out of school for like a decade now and am doing this for my own continued education, not any class) where I can give this causality engine:

- A react code-base (like this one)
- Some UML diagrams
- Some IxD sketch mock-ups 

And it can make a PR do implement the diagrams and mock-ups in the code-base... well, that's the ultimate 10 year vision anyway, but for now, let's start with chapters and homeworks

## Chapter 1: Probability, Graphs, and Causal Models

Key concepts:

- graph representation
- markov compatibility of probability distribution and graph
- d-separation criteria
- inference in causal bayesian networks

# Appendix

## A1 - Random Math Problem

Fuck, got nerd-snip'd by the some [apples, bananas, and pineapples](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-find-the-positive-integer-solutions-to-frac-x-y+z-+-frac-y-z+x-+-frac-z-x+y-4/answer/Alon-Amit)

## Autogenerated Stuff

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
