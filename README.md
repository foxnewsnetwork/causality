# Causality

Here is my attempt to create a utility library that captures the contents behind [Causality](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/book-toc.html) book and to use it to complete the [associated homework assignments](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/viewgraphs.html). Finally, to demonstrate that I've at least somewhat come to understand this field, I'd like to use all this to build a "class project" (in quotes because I've been out of school for like a decade now and am doing this for my own continued education, not any class) where I can give this causality engine:

- A react code-base (like this one)
- Some UML diagrams
- Some IxD sketch mock-ups 

And it can make a PR do implement the diagrams and mock-ups in the code-base... well, that's the ultimate 10 year vision anyway, but for now, let's start with chapters and homeworks

## Chapter 1: Probability, Graphs, and Causal Models

Key concepts:

- graph representation
- markov compatibility of probability distribution and graph
- d-separation criteria
- inference in causal bayesian networks

## Chapter 2: Tensorflow Botting

The objective here is to setup a bot that can:

- Interpret video / audio streams
- Use some form of AI library
- Send keystrokes and mouse clicks

Then use all this to automate various tasks from playing videos to basic work tasks
